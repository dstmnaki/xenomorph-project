Xenomorph E2 Project
MADE TO WORK ON BUILDSTRUCT

Info
Currently contains only the Sevastopol Drone variant but more are planned when i get the entire base done
The xeno itself does not support duping but the vents do, so you can make a map out of props and have them be part of it

Ai Update (WIP)
AI can be turned on at line 50
Ai features:
Venting system (if near a vent it has 3 options, ignore, consider, vent) when it's considering, it stops and waits for a random duration of time, 2-3 seconds and either ignores or vents, while in a vent it can wait from 15 seconds up to 30 seconds until exiting
Detection by sound (gunshots up to 4k source units, footsteps 'player velocity based' up to 1k source units)
Detection by sight (120 degrees vision with up to 2k source units distance, the detection of players has a build up, the closer you are or faster you move the faster it sees you and comes after you)
