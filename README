Xenomorph E2 Project
MADE TO WORK ON BUILDSTRUCT

Info
Currently contains only the Sevastopol Drone variant but more are planned when i get the entire base done
The xeno itself does not support duping but the vents do, so you can make a map out of props and have them be part of it

WASD - Move
Shift - Run
Space - Vent (while near one)
Control - Change stance
Alt - Toggle third person
Mouse1 - Headbite (while in normal upright mode, tail down on the ground)
